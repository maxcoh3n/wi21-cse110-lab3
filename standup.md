### Max

#### What did you do yesterday?

Yesterday I started the CSS lab. I created an issue template, i broke down the tasks into issues, and I coded up and resolved the majority of them via PRs.

#### What will you do today?

I will finish the lab and turn it in on canvas.

#### Where are you blocked?

I am not really blocked. I just need to get more familiar with flexbox, grid, and the box model.


#### Comfort Level â€” How close are we to hitting our sprint goals?

I am very confident that I will finish.
